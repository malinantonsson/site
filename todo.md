# Todo
I'm planning on building this site in steps, hoping to get version 1 live ASAP. 

## V.1
Version 1 will be a very basic static site with just an index.html & css.

## V.2
Using a progressive enhancement approach to add js functionality if enabled. 
Functionality:
- use vue.js to create a list filter 

## V.3
- Use vue.js/nunjucks to display more information for each project. Possibly as an overlay. Make sure to include static version of each page as well. Enable clientside routing.
